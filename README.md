# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio: A Journey from Draft to Digital Canvas üåü

Hello there! I'm Enyang, and this is my personal portfolio, hosted at [enyang.github.io](https://enyang.github.io). What you see here is the culmination of a unique journey - one that began with a humble draft and evolved into this hand-coded website.

## The Genesis of My Digital Space üöÄ
This portfolio is not just a collection of projects; it's a narrative of growth and learning. I started with nothing but a draft - a canvas of possibilities. Each line of code was typed with intention, each design choice made with care. No templates, no shortcuts. Just pure, handcrafted code.

## Hand-Coded with Love and Precision ‚ù§Ô∏èüîß
From HTML to CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript, every aspect of this site was manually coded. This hands-on approach allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of web development, understanding each element's role in painting the bigger picture.

## Why Start from Scratch?
I believe that the best way to learn and grow is by doing. Building this site from the ground up gave me the opportunity to explore, make mistakes, and learn in the most organic way possible. Every challenge faced was a lesson learned, making this portfolio more than just a website - it's a testament to my journey as a developer.

## Streamlined Project Management with Jira üìäüõ†Ô∏è
In the development of this portfolio, I embraced a meticulous approach to project management using Jira. This was not just about coding a website; it was about creating an efficient workflow and tracking my progress with precision.

### Task Tracking and Time Management ‚è±Ô∏è
Each task, from the smallest tweak in CSS to the larger structural changes in HTML, was diligently logged in Jira. This allowed me to not only stay organized but also to reflect on my workflow and improve it continuously.

### Automating Efficiency
I took a step further by integrating Jira with my Git commits. I set up automation in Jira to read the time logged in each commit message. This ingenious setup enabled me to track the actual time spent on different aspects of the website directly in Jira. It was a game-changer, providing me with insights into my work patterns and helping me optimize my time for various tasks.

### A Testament to Time and Effort
The result? A comprehensive overview of the time and effort invested in each segment of this website. This level of tracking and analysis not only improved my efficiency but also provided me with a clear understanding of the development lifecycle. It's a testament to the dedication I have put into this project, ensuring every minute counts.
