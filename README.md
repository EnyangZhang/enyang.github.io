# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio: A Journey from Draft to Digital Canvas üåü

Hello there! I'm Enyang, and this is my personal portfolio, hosted at [enyang.github.io](https://enyang.github.io). What you see here is the culmination of a unique journey - one that began with a humble draft and evolved into this hand-coded website.

## The Genesis of My Digital Space üöÄ
This portfolio is not just a collection of projects; it's a narrative of growth and learning. I started with nothing but a draft - a canvas of possibilities. Each line of code was typed with intention, each design choice made with care. No templates, no shortcuts. Just pure, handcrafted code.

## Hand-Coded with Love and Precision ‚ù§Ô∏èüîß
From HTML to CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript, every aspect of this site was manually coded. This hands-on approach allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of web development, understanding each element's role in painting the bigger picture.

## Why Start from Scratch?
I believe that the best way to learn and grow is by doing. Building this site from the ground up gave me the opportunity to explore, make mistakes, and learn in the most organic way possible. Every challenge faced was a lesson learned, making this portfolio more than just a website - it's a testament to my journey as a developer.
